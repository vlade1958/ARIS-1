DATAMODEL FOR ARIS-1 (Archival Regional Information System - version 1)

Datamodel was developed through the archival practice in years 1997-2023 while working as archivist in the Regional Archive of Koper. Used database engines: MS Access, MySQL. In the period 1997-2008 it was first used in MS Access applications for archival description and later for client-server application ARIS (used MySQL for the server-side database and MS Access for the client-side app).
In years 2008-2009 we developed web application ARIS based on the same datamodel which is in production use from 2009 till now (2024).
